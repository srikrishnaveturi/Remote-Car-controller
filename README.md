#Remote Rpi controller using flutter

#Steps :

First,you need the "motion" software installed on your rpi and connect the PI Camera with the RPi

Now, you're all set to go!

Just open up the app, enter the ip address of the RPi, and you can see the livestream from the Pi Camera and you can control the bot by the joystick and the button by running the python script "rpi_controller" on the RPi.

<h1>Note</h1> : the "rpi_controller" script is only for the rpi, transfer it into your rpi and then delete it from the local repository,there is no need to keep it in the app files!
